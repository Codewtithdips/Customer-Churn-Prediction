# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, as retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques, helping businesses take proactive measures to retain customers.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source**: (Mention dataset source - e.g., Kaggle, UCI, or synthetic)
- **Description**: Contains customer demographics, account details, and behavioral features.
- **Key Features**:
  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer
  - `Age`, `Gender`, `Tenure`: Customer demographic information
  - `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`: Payment-related details
  - `Churn`: Target variable (Yes/No)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost
